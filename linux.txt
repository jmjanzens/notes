# tree intricacies
tree ./ -d // only print directories
tree ./ -P <file>.<suffix> 	// only print file which match Pattern
				// wildcards allowed.
        -f                      // shows full path in ea.

# aliases
alias q='echo cry cry cry' // entering q will trigger echo

# to make aliases permanent (ubuntu, mint):
modify "/etc/bash.bashrc", format:
  alias newalias='sh ~/runMe.sh'

### (bash) repeat command 30 times with variable
$ 
for i in {1..30}; do udevadm info --name=/dev/ttyUSB$i | grep 'MAJOR\|MINOR'; done

#c shell
tcsh

#to switch shells
$ sh
> tcsh // or bash, etc.

### to switch shells automatically on next startup
$ chsh //change shell
> /bin/tcsh //path to shell

#to clear current command line
Ctrl+u //clears
Ctrl+c //clears, and starts new line

#to clear screen
Ctrl+l //seems to be same thing as '$ clear' command

#show list of usb devices (mouse, keyboard, etc)
$ lsusb

# network connections
$ netstat -ant

### jobs basics
Ctrl+z //suspend job
$ jobs //see list of jobs
$ fg //resume first job
$ fg %2 //resume second jobs

### terminate/kill suspended job
$ kill <PID>

### view remote directories
$ ssh <user@host> <command> 
 // e.g. `ssh jmjanzen@192.168.1.68 ls -l ~/myscripts`
// set aliases for common user@host in ~/.ssh/config for convenience
// $ man ssh-config for howto

### secure copy FROM remote TO local (scp)
$ scp <user@host>:<~/remote/path> <~/local/path>

### secure copy TO remote FROM local (scp)
$ scp <local/file.ext> <user@host>:<~/remote/path>

### list (ls) directory contents recusively
-R
i.e. $  ls -lR | grep '\.js' --color=always

### show Linux version, distro, kernal number, etc
$ uname --all or -a
/* or */
$ cat /proc/version

### how to read a simple diff
$ diff <a> <b>
< a version
---
> b version

### how to print a side-by-side diff
diff a b --side-by-side /*or*/ -y

### print diff like git does
diff a b -u // 'unified' style

### disk and memory commands
df //file system disk space usage
du //estimate file space usage
free -h //free and used memory

### remove need for ssh passphrase
$ ssh-keygen -p
/* then provide key (default: ~/.ssh/id_rsa)
   then enter old passphrase
   then enter new passphrase x2 */

### view all services
$ sudo service --status-all
// [+] = running
// [-] = stopped
// [?] = service managed by 'upstart'

### view services managed by 'upstart'
$ initctl list

### preserve environment when running sudo
sudo -E <command(s)>

### preserve alias when running sudo
sudo -s <alias>

### repeat specific number command from `history`
$ history
	1	ls
	2	cat thing
	3	vi -O thing thing2
$ !2 //repeats `cat thing`

### understand netstat interface display
$ netstat -i
/* in last column:
   (long flag names shows in ipconfig)
	B = A broadcast address has been set.
	L = This interface is a loopback device.
	M = All packets are received (promiscuous mode).
	O = ARP is turned off for this interface.
	P = This is a point-to-point connection.
	R = Interface is running.
	U = Interface is up. 
*/


### command line tricks ###
### cut and paste command line
^u //cut
^y //paste
### jump to beginning / end of cmd line
^a, or HOME //beginning
^e, or END  //end
### repeat long lines
ls dir/{,subdir} //== ls dir/ dir/subdir
